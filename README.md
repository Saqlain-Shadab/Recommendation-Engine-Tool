## üìö Recommendation Engine Tool
</div>

  
**Project Overview**  
This project builds a **personalized recommendation system** using **Collaborative Filtering** with **Implicit Feedback** such as clicks, views, or purchases. The objective is to infer user preferences and suggest relevant items without relying on explicit ratings.

---

**Dataset Overview**  
The dataset consists of:

- **User-Item Interactions**: Implicit signals like clicks, watch time, purchases  
- **User IDs**: Unique identifiers for users  
- **Item IDs**: Unique identifiers for items/products  
- **Confidence Weights**: Interaction strengths used to weight preferences  

---

**Objectives**  

- Preprocess interaction data into a user-item matrix  
- Train a collaborative filtering model using **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**  
- Generate top-N item recommendations for each user  
- Evaluate model performance using ranking metrics like **Recall@K**, **MAP**, and **AUC**

**Key Insights from the Engine**  

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Implicit Feedback Handling**  

- Unlike explicit feedback (ratings), this system uses behaviors like:  
  - ‚úÖ Clicks  
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Time spent  
  - üõí Purchases  
  - ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites  

- These signals are treated as **positive preferences**  
- The model infers what users like without direct input  

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture (ALS Matrix Factorization)**  

- Uses **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** to decompose the user-item matrix  
- Assigns **latent factors** to users and items  
- Predicts preferences by multiplying these latent vectors  
- Optimized for **sparse matrices** and scalable to large datasets  

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation Output**  

- For each user based on their "customerid", the model recommends items with the highest predicted preference scores
